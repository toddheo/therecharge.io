        2-1 Birth of Recharge Token
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        PiggyCell, a new power bank sharing platform, has been installed in more
        than thirty thousand branches across the major cities in South Korea.
        According to CoinDesk, the age group who are most interested in crypto
        technologies and cryptocurrencies is 20s to 30s in 2021. It is estimated
        that there are more than 3 million virtual asset trading users in South
        Korea as of May 2021. In particular, the age group called 2030
        generation accounts for approximately 59% of crypto users, and they seem
        to adapt easily to the changing technology trends while also actively
        using these services. This age group directly aligns with most users in
        PiggyCell platforms.
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        PiggyCell service so far has been an “One-way service” which provide
        only limited-service options such as borrowing mobile power bank from
        its Kiosk. With the adoption of blockchain ecosystem that substantially
        enhances the utilities as well as compatibility, PiggyCell service would
        take an important part in throughout what so-called “The Recharge
        Ecosystem” that is fueled by Recharge Token. PiggyCell are primarily
        plugged into Recharge Ecosystem in which various additional functions
        related to electric charging and shared economy are provided from
        100percent. In addition, by encouraging the use of electric energy, the
        amount of carbon emissions is reduced, and incentives are provided while
        similar services work together to expand this ecosystem. They all share
        the vision and mission of “easy, cheap, and direct”, “shared economy”,
        “environmental”, and “continuous growth”.

      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        Recharge token aims to encourage re-use of energy for long term
        sustainable ecosystem that brings positive effect on environments and
        blockchain world. It is designed to circulate on its own with minimized
        intervention from centralized while providing constructive blockchain
        ecosystem. With its highly compatible concept, if electric, anyone, and
        any partner can be plugged in to the ecosystem to build
        environmental-friendly blockchain economy.

        2-2 What is a Recharge Token?
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        Recharge Token is a native token in the ecosystem centered on
        100percent’s electric based services. Utilities that Recharge Tokens
        primarily provide are listed below,
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        - Recharge Governance: Users can participate in the important
        decision-making process to help shape the future of a protocol.
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        - Service Payment: Integrated ecosystem partner services are open to
        Recharge Token holders once connected. Recharge Tokens are converted
        into points through the services connected to the ecosystem and those
        points can be used to enjoy other services.
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        - The ecosystem built through the Recharge Token can be expanded to any
        electric based services and EV Charging Complex is the 1st example.
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        - Through the automatic incineration functions of the Recharge Token,
        when a transaction occurs, carbon redemption points are accumulated
        while an automatic cycle is run to use portions of the points to
        purchase carbon credits. The purchased carbon credits are kept till
        expired not to be used.

        2-3 Recharge Token Purpose
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        Recharge Token aims to build and expand the current ecosystem related to
        charging by combining the already existing Piggy Cell service with
        blockchain technology. Thus, it will provide a Turnkey Solution for
        charging related in the future. That is, it will establish the basis of
        charging stations and pave the way as the representative charging
        service in the market.

        2-4 Recharge Token Ecosystem
      </div>
      <div className="semiTitle Roboto_20pt_Black_L">2-4-1. Overview</div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        The basis of the Recharge Token’s ecosystem is initially being built
        around Piggy Cell’s service platform, which is maintained through both
        automatic and manual circulation of the Frequent Use Points depending on
        function, purpose, and use. Subsequently, EV Charging Complex and other
        charging related services will be added. By linking these independent
        services, it synergistically links rental, charging, and product
        management and service payment together under the concept of electric
        charging stations, ultimately reaching the vision of providing a turnkey
        solution through the Recharge Stations. In addition to their own
        specific functions, each node of the platforms supports the use,
        collection, and exchange of the accumulated points which in turn
        increases the use and value of the Recharge Tokens.
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        The Recharge Token ecosystem is designed based on an in & out interface
        so that various functions to be easily added, deleted, and changed. This
        allows various platforms, modules, and methods to be added on. This has
        great potential for expansion because it not only supports the
        corresponding platforms but also additional platforms by using the
        shared synergy points. With it being a combination of “Big ones” rather
        than “Small ones”, resource management is highly efficient in terms of
        operation and maintenance.
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        The nodes in which the points are used automatically accumulate a
        certain percentage of the transaction when a token transaction is made.
        In other words, accumulation is generated through these transactions and
        the exchange of these Recharge Tokens, and the continuous accumulation
        of points creates an increase in APY and a positive cycle in which the
        ecosystem flourishes. With the addition of EV Charging Complex, other
        charging services, exchange listings (DEX and CEX) and so on, they
        accelerate the current accumulation rate of the Recharge Tokens.
      </div>
      <div className="semiTitle Roboto_20pt_Black_L">
        2-4-2 FUP Frequent Use Points
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        The Frequent Use Points play an important role in configuring,
        maintaining, and activating the Recharge Token ecosystem. These points
        are designed for contributors and holders who organize and operate the
        Recharge Token ecosystem. The accumulated points are converted into
        Recharge Tokens through Recharge Stations and Recharge Swaps. While it
        is true that the module-combined Small one ecosystem could bring
        security issues and lower the performance with regards to the
        combination of the interface nodes in each module, these concerns could
        be resolved through the accumulated points as well. The interface nodes
        of all combined modules can minimize performance failures by playing a
        role as a path and verification process, and users can also solve
        security issues by storing and using the points they gained in their
        personal wallets.
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        The accumulated points are naturally circulated through each module and
        nodes such as PiggyCell and EV charging complex within the Recharge
        Token ecosystem and support the smooth execution of the predetermined
        functions of each module.

      <div className="semiTitle Roboto_20pt_Black_L">
        2-4-3 Carbon Redemption (CRE)
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        Automated Token Burn of Recharge Token is named as Carbon Redemption
        (CRE) Recharge Token discounts carbon redemption when a transaction
        occurs. The discounted points are stored at Incentive Hub (IH) and
        transferred to each incentive rewarding service in accordance with a
        fixed schedule (weekly, monthly, bi-weekly), excluding the carbon credit
        purchase rate. All accumulations are managed and implemented by a
        distributed ledger to ensure transparency and integrity. The carbon
        redemption points recorded in this document can be continuously updated
        through governance, and snapshots will be taken periodically in
        consideration of the productivity of the ecosystem. However, when other
        transactions occur within Piggy Cell and EV Charging Complex that do not
        involve Recharge Tokens, or simply, when transactions occur through
        internal services, points are not discounted for quantitative
        preservation purposes.
      </div>
      <div className="text Roboto_20pt_Regular_L">
        10% of the Recharge accumulated in Incentive Hub is used to purchase
        carbon credits, and the remaining 90% of the tokens are used as
        incentives for ecosystem building such as staking reward. Ratio of each
        distribution can change through Recharge Governance on Snapshot.org.

        rights. All personal wallets holding Recharge Tokens can participate in
        voting by voting for or against the governance measure. However, in the
        case of Recharge Token wallets held in the Centralized Exchange (CEX),
        eligibility is determined by the individual exchanges. Holders
        participating in the governance voting can receive Recharge Tokens as
        incentives in accordance with the results of their votes.
